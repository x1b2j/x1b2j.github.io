<p style="text-align:left;">hello people,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I am here again after bashing (though it was a logical talk on '<a href="https://www.facebook.com/thecclubkiet/posts/644367325587048">the_c_club'</a>) some morons. So today I will not go for needless talking, instead I will just come to the main point. The biggest question of all the time is "I am new to linux, from where should I begin (don't ask me "when ?" because you know better than anyone else on the planet, except google)...???"</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So the answer is, you can start from anywhere you want. I know, this sentence is not going to help most of the people but as soon as you get into the situation as I am, you are going to say the same sentence. Anyway, the following guidelines are for everyone (irrespective to some prior knowledge of *.nix system)...</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">#. First of all leave window$...it is the most stupid operating system on the planet. I know its hard to do this for most of the people but you have to pay something, in order to get rid of your bad habits of using window$. I expect that most of the people will go for dual boot systems (window$ + linux) but I bet there are 98% people out there who can't learn linux, if there is some shitty os called window$ exists on there machine. So mark my words "GO FOR SINGLE STANDALONE LINUX INSTALLATION IN ORDER TO LEARN linux, THERE IS NO OTHER WAY..IF THERE IS WINDOW$ ON YOUR SYSTEM, I AM DAMN SURE THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS OPEN IT IN IDEAL SITUATION (YOU MIGHT SWITCH TO LINUX AFTER READING MY POST, BUT ITS NOT ENOUGH...).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">#. Second thing is for those who say that i have some crucial data on the disk, and hence I can't take any risk of loosing data. So I want to ask "what kind of data do you have???..some collection of movies, songs, pdfs, documentories, video lectures, shitty window$ softwares, ..porn.. ..etc...". I will give a word of advice that just backup your images (your memories) and all other data which you can't find anywhere else..and rest "just wipe and erase"..its just a stream of 0's and 1's, nothing else..you can get it from anywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">#. The third point is that don't be afraid of experimenting. If you want to learn some hardcore engineering stuff then don't panic. You can't damage your hardware at any situation (unless you are playing with it)...so don't be shy...if you think that some particular thing should work like this then go and see if you are right...(THIS POINT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT). No one can teach you anything, the only thing is that someone can show you the path (the same thing i am trying to do). You have to go through that path, as there is no other option. Its not a bed of roses.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">#. Keep some diary or something like that in which you can note down important things. Also it will give you the option to keep track of what you have done in the past, for future reference. Don't feel insulted while making proper notes..(now don't make bullshit notes as you do in the class).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">#. THE KEY POINT IS ... "TRY TO SPEND TIME WITH LINUX AS MUCH AS YOU CAN...ITS ALWAYS BE LESSER, NO MATTER HOW MUCH EFFORT YOU ARE PUTTING...ONCE YOU START DOING THIS..STRETCH YOURSELF TO LIMITS...TRY TO ACHIEVE MADNESS...".</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">#. One last thing (but not the least one) before I list out the reference material is: always bear in mind...
"HARD WORK BEATS the TALENT, WHEN TALENT FAILS TO WORK HARD..."</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">...so don't think that you got a lighter brain than someone else...you brain is as capable of as other 99.999% peoples' brain is...if you are determined, you can do anything under the sky...don't ever compare yourself to others, instead be true to yourself...</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">###. which distribution should i use:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">No linux distribution is good or bad...its just upto the user what he/she wants...so choose your distro carefully...there are a larger number of linux distros out there than you can even imagine...i haven't used more than 10% of them (though i got a three digits number).
$. Though i can list a lot of linux distributions and talk about technicalities yet i am leaving this task to the reader him/herself. I want everyone to choose the distro he/she likes (depending upon the use, hardware and other constraints), so I am just listing the links where you can find a match for your own linux distro (PLEASE DON'T LIMIT YOURSELF TO THESE LINKS...TRY TO BE FREE FLOWING ON THE INTERNET) :</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">1. <a href="http://www.zegeniestudios.net/ldc/">zegeniestudios</a> : this is the site where you can customize your distro for specific use, also it provides help feature while choosing a particular functionality. <a href="http://tuxradar.com/content/distro-picker-0">tuxradar</a> and <a href="http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major">distrowatch</a> also have the same functionality.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">2. <a href="http://www.linux.com/directory/Distributions">linux.com</a>: this is the best site for this purpose. i will recommend you to go through this.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">3. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5889950/how-to-find-the-perfect-linux-distribution-for-you">lifehacker</a> : this is a blog from where you can start. this will give you an insight into the major linux distributions.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">4. <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/choosing-a-linux-distribution">rackspace</a> : this will give you a small list of main distros and some information about them.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Apart from these links there are infinite links on the internet, these might not be the best ones but these links will give you a solid start.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">If you ask me for my opinion, I would like to suggest the following distros:
&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">fedora</a> - this is not for the newly born babies in the linux world. As it is the red hat's experimental version, it comes with several latest softwares which are not even launched into the open source world (my personal favourite).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/">mint</a> - mint is a linux distribution with good hardware support. If you are new, this is best for you (its just a suggestion as it was also my first one).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">ubuntu</a> - ubuntu also is one of the best distros available in the market which is evolving on the daily basis. This is one of the most beautiful distribution which attracts user in the desktop market.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.kali.org/">kali</a> - kali linux is the reborn linux distribution from backtrack linux. It is the famous distro for its security auditing and penetration testing capabilities. It is not suitable for babies in the tux world.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&gt;&gt;&gt; apart from these there are several others like debian, open suse, arch linux, mandriva, puppy, centos...you can choose any from these...no matter which distro you choose there is always the same heart (kernel).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">###. installation:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">depending on the distribution you choose, go through the official documentation of that specific distro. you can easily adopt the installation steps and fire up your terminal soon.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">###. reference material:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">#. The best teacher on the internet is wikipedia. So make sure you are spending more than 3-4 hours per day (at least 2 hours) with wikipedia. This will give you the deep understanding of the topic. And also it will balance your theoretical and practical knowledge at the same time. This is the most common place, no matter from where you are reading or learning something, ultimately you have to come here. Everyday choose something to learn, search it on wikipedia. The following infinite loop shows the beauty of wikipedia...</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">for(;;){
As soon as you start reading some page there would be some link after 3-4 lines that you might be unaware of. You just click on that and now you are on some different page...this goes deeper and deeper...you never come back to the topic from where you started...;
}
so feel free to wander here and there for some random knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">#. For Beginners :
$. PLEASE ALWAYS GO THROUGH THE WIKIPEDIA PAGE FOOTER...click the links...these links will open the door of the actual sources from where the content of the page has been taken...through these links you can find amazing stuff that you will never find on google...
$. go to <a href="http://www.linux.org/">http://www.linux.org/</a>. here you can find 3 categories of tutorials: beginners, intermediate and expert. go through all of them thoroughly depending on your understanding level.
$. if you are an ubuntu user (or any debian-based distro) then this is the place where you must be all the time... <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/">https://help.ubuntu.com/</a>. The same thing applies for all other distros, means always go through the official documentation.
$. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a> is a website used for troubleshooting purposes. I usually get 70% answers for all my queries from here.
$. <a href="http://tldp.org/">the linux documentation project</a> is a place where you can find the actual documentation of everything under the sky for *.nix systems. This is the official community driven site for linux which includes extensive documentation on kernel, programs, networking, device drivers and all topics that anyone can imagine in the linux world.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Though I have a lot of things to write but I can't write into a single blog. So I will add those things in my next blog (guidelines for the intermediate and power users). I have tried my best to write some important points for a beginner but i know this is not enough. And one thing also I would like to mention that I am a geek, not a writer, so please don't expect some heavy language from me. I tried to keep it simple as I could.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I hope this would be beneficial for some people who are willing to learn linux. "WELCOME TO THE TUX WORLD, ENJOY, ITS ALL ABOUT FREEDOM, YOU ARE FREE TO DO ANYTHING".</p>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
